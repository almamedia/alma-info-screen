# Info screen
Opens and refreshes web pages automatically on local or remote devices (OSX).

By default the pages are shown side-by-side and refreshed once per minute.

Can be setup to rotate urls in full-screen (5s interval)

Every one hour Chrome is rebooted.

# Requirements
## Remote machine:
* Install Google Chrome
* Setup SSH
* (Optional) Install Ublock origin

## Local:
* Install git (should be included in OSX)
* Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/almamedia/alma-info-screen.git && cd alma-info-screen`
* If already cloned, pull the latest changes: `git pull`

# Setup
## Split screen
To install split screen run the following script (1-4 pages as parameters):

`./setup.sh https://example.com https://example2.com`

The pages should pop up and start refreshing automatically.
If the pages are not aligned correctly just drag them to the correct places.

### Timer
Use TIMER variable to set the refresh interval in minutes, if set to zero then no refresh is used.

Default timer for split screen is one minute.

`TIMER=2 ./setup.sh https://example.com https://example2.com`

## Tab rotate
To install tab rotate run the following script (2-20 pages as parameters):

`TYPE=ROTATE ./setup.sh https://example.com https://example2.com https://example3.com https://example4.com`

The first page should open in full-screen, and urls should start rotating in one minute with 5s interval.

### Timer
If timer is used with **TYPE=ROTATE**, it specifies seconds, not minutes.

Default timer for tab rotate is 5 seconds.

`TIMER=30 TYPE=ROTATE ./setup.sh https://example.com https://example2.com https://example3.com https://example4.com`

## Remote setup

Scripts can be run on a remote machine, by prepending the TARGET and USER environment variables before the script:

`TARGET=128.128.128.128 USER=exampleuser ./setup.sh https://example.com https://example2.com`

`TARGET=128.128.128.128 USER=exampleuser TIMER=0 ./setup.sh https://example.com https://example2.com`
